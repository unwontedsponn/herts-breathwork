          <p>What could be simpler than guided breathing exercises in the palm of your hand? Enter, Moonbird. Select an exercise, place your thumb on the sensor, and Moonbird will begin to physically expand - your cue to breathe in. Then, as Moonbird contracts, breathe out, and repeat for the duration of your exercise. This intuitive and tactile little device really helps you focus and get calm.
