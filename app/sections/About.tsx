        <h2>I was a different person before I found breathwork. It completely changed my life.</h2>
        <p>Which is why I love sharing its power and bringing people together in community to connect more deeply, not only with themselves but with other people and the world around them.</p>
        <p>As a fully qualified Transformational BreathÂ® Group Leader and accredited Life Coach, I&apos;ve worked with hundreds of clients and seen how simply improving their breath can truly transform their lives. </p>
        <p>Change the way you breathe, change the way you live!</p>
        <p>I facilitate deeply healing breathwork sessions and intimate group workshops (both online and in person) from Seven Sisters Sanctuary in London; a cosy oasis of calm in the busy city.</p>
